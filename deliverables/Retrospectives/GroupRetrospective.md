#What went well in the group?

* Our group demonstrated strong collaboration and communication throughout the project . We consistently supported each other and ensured tasks were divided fairly according to individual strengths with consistent progress on project milestones. Regular meetings helped keep everyone on track, and there was a strong commitment to delivering quality work as there was a supportive team environment. We were able to resolve any challenges that arose quickly and effectively, ensuring smooth progress throughout the project as there was clear vision of responsibilities.

# What could have been better in the group?

* While communication was generally effective, there were a few instances where some members were unclear on certain aspects of the project scope or had different interpretations of tasks. More detailed planning and clearer documentation of expectations could have helped avoid minor confusion. Additionally, a better balance of participation could have improved efficiency in the later stages of the project with balanced workload distribution. The development platform also should have been chosen wisely based on each member's knowledge and experience.

# What went well in the class?

* The class provided a solid foundation in both theory and practical application, which significantly contributed to our understanding of software development with very effective guest lectures which made our vision more clear. The instructor was clear and approachable, offering helpful guidance when needed. The assignments were well-structured, giving us the chance to apply our knowledge and learn new skills in a hands-on environment. We got to try some new things too with completely new people.

# What could have been better in the class?

* Continuously keeping track of the project should have been better so that the students can be more focused on the project. A 10-15 group meeting slot should be added within the class as online meetings are not so effective.
