# Guest Lecture Response

* **Guest Lecturer:** Todd Irlbeck
* **Company:** Riverside Research
* **Date:** Thursday, 10 October 2024

## Pertinent Questions

* Do the developers on his team use AI? No really. They don't want their skills to go to bad.

* Is this company a consultation firm or a software development firm? It is both! Within the scope of the government they do what it takes to serve America and national security. The point is to have high adoption rates.

## Lessons Learned

* Working for the government is a much slower process than what we are used to at WSU. 

* However, the faster the product is delivered the better. RR's focus is delivering what the customer actually needs.

* User Stories are much better than product requirements. They discover what the customer actually needs (abstraction instead of implementation).

* Our team needs to self assign the tasks in Taiga. 

## Difference between definitions taught in class and provided by the Guest Lecturer

* Collaborating with the customer is much more focused on why as opposed to User Stories.

* They use Minimum Usable Product instead of Minimum Viable Product. They want the product to be adopted not just meeting the minimum specifications.
