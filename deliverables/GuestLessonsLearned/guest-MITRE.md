## Pertinent Questions

* How do you communicate with your team? Team communication: MS team; Jira boards or issue tracking; slack; Confluence for documentation.

## Lessons Learned

* General SE advice: follow the Admin Zen (take good notes; know your tools; backup; communicate); invest in yourself; diversify; keep it logically awesome.

* Personal (dev log for himself); Obsidian is great; zettlecasten; the point is to save crap because we can't remember absolutely everything.

## Difference between definitions taught in class and provided by the Guest Lecturer
