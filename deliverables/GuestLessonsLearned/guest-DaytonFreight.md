## Pertinent Questions
* How is communication accomplished across diverse teams with remote developers? They use MS Teams and specially designed conference rooms to connect the necessary team members to each other in a manner that facilitates quick and effective communication. One-on-one chats are often done over video.

* What determines how projects are prioritized? This is a complicated questions and it often boils down to the expected return on investment. Are the costs and man hours estimated to be worth it to the company and the stakeholders in a time frame that makes sense for the company in the current market environment? Not an easy question to answer. 

## Lessons Learned
* Our project and MVS must reflect some sort of prioritization that can be deafened. 

* Scrum may not have been the right choice for our development team. Kanban might have been a better fit.

* How should our team organize itself during the development process? At this point I think 2 teams of 2 people with the swing person might be ideal. Time will tell.

## Difference between definitions taught in class and provided by the Guest Lecturer

* The major point that stood out to me as a difference was that the class definition of a User Story has been taught as a thing that a user will do to achieve an objective, like press a specific button on an app to access the user profile information. Tim explained that for Dayton Freight a User Story defines a specific piece of work that must be pushed to production immediately after it is completed.
