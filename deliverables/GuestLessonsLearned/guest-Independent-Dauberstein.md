## Pertinent Questions

* For APIs he likes node express. Functional programming.

* He only answered the one question. Then everyone left.

## Lessons Learned

* Only pick tech that has proper documentation. 

* Do self inquiry: timer for 5 mins; write I am ... 20 times; fill in the end of each statement in the 5 mins. See what pops up that is new?

* Look at very old problems and learn to decompose them.

* Scott loves boxing. and talking about himself. and public speaking (mainly anything that puts him in front of people).

## Difference between definitions taught in class and provided by the Guest Lecturer

* I have no idea. I know a lot more about boxing and videography than I did before though. To be fair, I really liked the guy and I'm happy he gave us a presentation. He had a lot of information and resources that are more about learning and curiosity and less about internships/work life. I saved his slides because he put so much stuff in there that I personally find interesting.
