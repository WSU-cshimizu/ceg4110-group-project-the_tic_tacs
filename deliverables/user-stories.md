# The Tic Tacs User-Stories
---
## Overview:
The system will be both fun an educational for users of a younger demographic. Designed for children to practice math problems while earning experience points (XP). As they solve problems correctly they will be able to unlock avatars and will be rewared with different cat facts along the way as well.

### User-Stories

- Users will want a gameplay loop that is not too challenging as to elicit a lot of frustration, but to have enough stakes that users are engaged. An important rule is that answering correctly in a certain amount of time will increase the amount of score that the player gets. However, to make sure that the game is not too punishing, there will not be a time limit on answers, and players can take their time if need be.

### Developer stories

- As a developer, I will want to be able to efficiently manage and access user data, to make sure that the leveling up and score bonus functionalities always work. The math problems should also be quickly generated after the current one has been answered, as slow generation will hamper user engagement.
