# Software Development Plan: The Tic-Tacs

## Requirements
### **Administrative**

* Meeting Location(s) and Times: 
   > In Class: Tuesday and Thursday for 30 minutes 
   >
   > Virtually on Discord: Sunday at 6pm for 1 hour and as needed
* Communication Plan (Meeting Structure & Cadence): 
   > Meeting agenda is posted to Discord before each meeting
   >
   > Prior individual deliverables are communicated in person when available and on Discord 
   >
   > Each topic is covered as planned and the meeting concludes with time for questions, comments, and concerns
   >
   > The current meeting concludes with a brief summary of the discussion, agreements, individual deliverables, team deliverables, and points to cover in the next meeting. This information is posted to the team Discord and documented in the meeting minutes on the team repo.

* Communication Plan Justification:
   > The purpose of meeting at the times and locations is to work with the schedules and course loads for five team members. Due to the location of the team members it was determined that meeting virtually on Discord would be the most efficient use of time. Likewise, the redundancies of the Communication Plan provides all team members with the ability to review a missed meeting or check the specifications for personal responsibilities. 

* Project Management Justification:
   > The project will be managed via meetings and Scrum which will be tracked via Taiga. Decisions are made during meeting by the team members present. Following the Minimum Viable Specification deliverable we will do 2 sprints per check-in with our client. Our check-ins will be every 2 weeks after the MVS is delivered. This will allow us to iteratively include or exclude product features and/or functionality as required by the client. Sprints will focus on achieving the full functionality of a feature (for example a game mode) first with the following sprint focused on testing and code revision. The Minimum Viable Product must be delivered by Friday, 29 November 2024. With this absolute deadline in mind 3 team meetings per week and 1 sprint per week are considered reasonable by the development team.
