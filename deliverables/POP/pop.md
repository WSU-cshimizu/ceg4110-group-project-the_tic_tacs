## Project Name: Cath Math

##Elevator Pitch:
	
	
##Complexity and Components:

##Predicted Architecture:

##Tech Stack and Frameworks:

##Methodology and Lifecycle:

		
	
* Name of the proposed project
* Elevator pitch, which should at least answer
  * "Why are you building your _thing_?"
* _N_ "things of complexity", where _N_ is number of students in the group.
  * Describe each component, briefly.
* How do the components fit together (i.e., predicted architecture)?
    * Prompt: "We think, based on not touching it yet, we'll do..."
* What language or technology stack or framework will be used?
    * Include a response to: "why are you picking the tech stack that you are?"
* What is the predicted life cycle/methodology that you will follow?
