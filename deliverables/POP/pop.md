# Project Overview Proposal

## Project Name: Cath Math

### Elevator Pitch:

* My son is in 1st grade. They are doing math and math drills that focus on the basics. I was looking for an app for him to use as practice, and I did not find anything that he was interested in. His teacher says that there is a market for apps that support classroom activities. I think we should make an Andriod app called Cat Math. The app will support basic math as drills as well as function as a calculator. The kids love games, so I think a level system with XP points would be a great learning motivator. I would like to add animal science facts to support gradeschool science learning. The kids seem to love cats and they liked this idea. My team and I have worked out the basic tech stack and architecture. Can I send you a more formal proposal?
	
### Complexity and Components:

### Predicted Architecture:

### Tech Stack and Frameworks:

* Stuff

### Methodology and Lifecycle:

* _N_ "things of complexity", where _N_ is number of students in the group.
  * Describe each component, briefly.
* How do the components fit together (i.e., predicted architecture)?
    * Prompt: "We think, based on not touching it yet, we'll do..."
* What language or technology stack or framework will be used?
    * Include a response to: "why are you picking the tech stack that you are?"
* What is the predicted life cycle/methodology that you will follow?
