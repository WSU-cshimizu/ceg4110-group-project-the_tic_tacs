# Project Overview Proposal

## Project Name: Cat Math

### Elevator Pitch:

* My team and I have kids who are in grade school. They are doing math and math drills that focus on the basics. I was looking for an app for him to use as practice, and I did not find anything that he was interested in. His teacher says that there is a market for apps that support classroom activities. I think we should make an Android app called Cat Math. The app will support basic math as drills as well as function as a calculator. The kids love games, so I think a level system with XP points would be a great learning motivator. I would like to add animal science facts to support gradeschool science learning. The kids seem to love cats and they liked this idea. My team and I have worked out the basic tech stack and architecture. Can I send you a more formal proposal?
	
### Complexity and Components:

* Andriod OS based math drill and calculator app.
* UI with artwork: The user interface with be relatively simple with bright colors, easy for children to navigate.
* Experience Points (XP): A number which will increase the users level and serve as currency for the user to purchase cat or animal avatars.
* Reward correct answers with animal facts (especially cat facts): A window which provides extra educational content upon a correct answer.
* Math question mode: A component which will ask a basic math question. It will reward XP and a cat or animal fact upon a correct answer.
* Math drill mode: Timed basic math questions. It will reward XP and a cat or animal fact upon a correct answer.
* Calculator mode: The app will also be able to function as a basic calculator in increase user activity.

### Predicted Architecture:

* The Android app will function as a stand alone piece of software on Android devices. No backend will be necessary.

### Tech Stack and Frameworks:

* We will use Android Studio as our IDE and testing software. 
* React Native will be the "glue" in our tech stack.
* Java Script and Java will be the primary coding languages.
* These components will be subject to change as the project iterates through the lifecycle.

### Methodology and Lifecycle:

* Scrum administered via OpenProject or Taiga. 
* Jessica Venema will be the Scrum master.
* Sprints will be a weekly event.
* We will have standups at least twice a week.
