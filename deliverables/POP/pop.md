# Project Overview Proposal

## Project Name: Cath Math

### Elevator Pitch:

* My son is in 1st grade. They are doing math and math drills that focus on the basics. I was looking for an app for him to use as practice, and I did not find anything that he was interested in. His teacher says that there is a market for apps that support classroom activities. I think we should make an Andriod app called Cat Math. The app will support basic math as drills as well as function as a calculator. The kids love games, so I think a level system with XP points would be a great learning motivator. I would like to add animal science facts to support gradeschool science learning. The kids seem to love cats and they liked this idea. My team and I have worked out the basic tech stack and architecture. Can I send you a more formal proposal?
	
### Complexity and Components:

* It will have a UI, math question mode, math drill mode, calculator mode, XP and points to spend on avatars (primarily cats), and reward correct answers with animal facts (especially cat facts). 

### Predicted Architecture:

* The Andriod app will function as a stand alone piece of software on Andriod devices. No backend will be necessary.

### Tech Stack and Frameworks:

* We will use Andriod Studio as our IDE and testing software. 
* React Native will be the "glue" in our tech stack.
* Java Script and Java will be the primary coding languages.
* These components will be subject to change as the project iterates through the lifecycle.

### Methodology and Lifecycle:

* Scrum administered via OpenProject or Taiga. 
* Jessica Venema will be the Scrum master.
* Sprints will be a weekly event.
* We will have standups at least twice a week.
